# Mesh

A P2P standard made for realtime communication based on the fact that your contacts likely share at least some of yours (In development)

## Standard
 * [Messages.md](/Messages.md) - Message Types, how a node has to react and data formats.

## Implementations
 * [rust-mesh](https://github.com/Mesh-P2P/rust-mesh) - WIP - current official implementation
 * [node-mesh-core](https://github.com/Mesh-P2P/node-mesh-core) - abandoned - first implementation, even partly functional
